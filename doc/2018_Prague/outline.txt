Reproducibility

- Critical description of the lack of repeatability (let alone reproducibility) of my PhD dissertation.
- Crisis of reproducibility and current importance.
- What do I do to make my analysis reproducible.
	· Open Science Notebook
	· git and github
- What else I should be doing.

The unguarded X hypothesis

- Longevity differences between males and females.
- Adaptive hypotheses.
- Maladaptive hypotheses:
	· Mother's curse hypothesis
	· Unguarded X hypothesis

Drosophila

- Large proportion of X-linked genes.
- Dosage compensation system doubles expression of X genes in males: true heterozygosity in females.
- Previous work

The sexually antagonistic pleiotropy hypothesis

- Main prediction: intermediate allele frequencies maintained under selection balance.
- Contrast with UX prediction of low frequencies under mutation-selection balance.
- Even finding X-linked loci responsible for sex-specific inbreeding effects does not prove the UX hypothesis.
- Population genetic methods would not be useful.
- Quantitative genetics: John Kelly's experiment.
	· Motivation: lek paradox, genetic variation in fitness components.
	· Definition of terms: additive variance, correlation between additive effects and homozygous dominance deviations.
	· Sensitivity of their quotient to allele frequencies.
	· Estimation: increment of directional dominance (B) and response to selection.
	· Potential application to test the UX hypothesis.
	· Problems: to predict the change in B due to X-linked genes we would have to assume linkage equilibrium.
