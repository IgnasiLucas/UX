# It is time to find an expression for the survival function under the smurf
# model of aging. I finally decided to implement an ARS model: aging, reproducing
# and surviving (or not) happen in that order. See 2018-05-22. This means that
# the probability of reaching age 1 is the sum of the probabilities of two alternative
# events: not having become a smurf between 0 and 1, and having become one but
# surviving since then. Similarly, to reach age 2 one must either not become a
# smurf at all by age 2 (with probability N(2)=exp(-a·(2-t0)^2/2) if 2 > t0, or
# 1 otherwise), or to become a smurf before 2 and surviving since then (exp(-(2-i)·r),
# where 'i' is the time when it became a smurf and 'r' is the death rate.
#
# In continuous time, I believe that equation 1 in the survival.pdf document represents
# the right survival function of the two-phases model. Unfortunately, I don't know
# how to solve that integral. In discrete time, the survival function that describes
# the simulations is that of equations 2 and 3 in the same document. Note that
# the discrete-time expression underestimates the chance of surviving during the
# cycle (day) that the individual became a smurf. But the same error is implemented
# in the simulations.
#
# The survival function should help determine the exact selecion coefficient
# against an allele that increases the rate of becoming smurfs, 'a'. That will give
# a theoretical expectation of the allele frequency at equilibrium. I take
# fitness to be the lifetime expected reproduction, which in discrete ages is:
#
#       inf
#   R = SUM S(x)F(x)
#       x=1
#
# Where S(x) is the survival function, and F(x) the fecundity. Fecundity should
# reach a maximum shortly after emergence (say, day 12 from egg), and then decline
# with age. I could use a function like 1 - ((x - 12)^2) / 100.
#
# The script survival.py outputs a list of survival probabilities for each
# combination of 'a' and 'b' values.

# Say that the 'a' parameter of the two-stages aging model is 0.0039 for
# either females or males with the 0 allele. That is the empirical value
# estimated by Tricoire and Rera (2015). Allele 1 increses 'a'. Below, I
# represent the fitness and the selection coefficient against allele 1 as
# a function of the increase it produces in 'a'. I assume reasonable values
# of 'a' may go up to 0.025. First, I assume constant fecundity, and then
# I apply a quadratic function of age to determine the number of offspring
# at every age.

# According to Fry (2009), who cites Rice (1984) and Hedrick (2000), the
# polimorphism will be stable if:
#
#        2·d         r      2·(1 - d)
#     ---------  <  --- <  -----------
#      1 + d·s       s       1 - d·s
#
# To make things simple, we can set 's' = 'r', and 'd' = 0.5, which does
# fulfill the stability condition. According to file fitness_a.txt, the
# following increments of 'a' ('e') produce such selection coefficients:
# 'r1' for constant fecundity, and 'r2' for age-depending fecundity according
# to: 1 - ((x-12)^2)/100.
