# I wrote the script mutationSelectionBalance.py, which simulates mutations
# on loci that affect the probability of becoming targeted for natural
# death. Mutant alleles all increase the parameter 'a' of the two-phases
# model of aging, and are therefore deleterious. They are recessive, and
# expressed in males if present in the X chromosome. The model includes
# 28 loci, with recombination. The gene effects are all equal and additive.
#
# The challenge is to adjust the parameter values to reproduce some real-life
# features. Mainly, a low but positive equilibrium allele frequency, and a
# longer lifespan for females (unguarded X hypothesis).
#
# The number of loci should be more than enough. The gene effects should be
# small for the equilibrium frequencies to be positive, but large enough to
# cause a difference in lifespan between males and females.
