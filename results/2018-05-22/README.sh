# I need to simulate several types of populations, and I want to go step
# by step. First, I should simulate a source population of flies with the
# following properties:
#   * At least 2000 individuals.
#   * With sexual conflict: at least one locus with opposite fitness effects
#     between sexes.
#   * Age-structured.
#   * Random mating.
#
# From the Wikipedia: "the last male to mate with a female sires about 80%
# of her offspring". They also say that females lay around 400 eggs.

# After gaining some familiarity with simuPOP, I have a better idea of what is
# feasible. So far, I got an age-structured population which implements the
# model of the two stages of aging: adults with zero mortality rate and smurfs
# with a constant mortaility rate. Two parameters, a and b control the rate of
# transformation of adults in smurfs, which increases linearly with age. Those
# two parameters could be reduced to one, assuming that only adults (at least
# 10 days old flies) and not larvae can be targeted by natural death. The aging
# rate parameter, thus, could be affected by either several deleterious
# spontaneous mutations in mutation-selection equilibrium, or by sexually
# antagonistic variation, maintained in the X chromosome (see James D. Fry,
# 2009, Evolution 64-5:1510-1516.).
#
# Some details of the life cycle are difficult to implement and can be left
# aside for later. For example, the polygamy.
#
# Only after being able to generate these two types of source populations,
# I will be in conditions to calculate the quantitative genetics parameters
# that John Kelly attempts to estimate with his experiments, and simulate the
# experiments themselves.
#
# The discontinuous two-phases model of aging says that during the first phase
# the probability of transitioning into the second ("smurf") phase increases
# linearly with age: y = ax + b, where x is the age (in days) and -b/a is the
# age at which flies start to become smurfs. The second phase is described by
# an exponential survival function: S(x) = exp(-kx), where k is the rate constant.
# Thus, the probability of dying during a certain day x is 1 - exp(-k).

# See Tricoire and Rera, 2015, 'A new, discontinuous 2 phases of aging model: lessons
# from Drosophila melanogaster', PLoS ONE ( https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0141920).
# The authors obtain the following estimates for the parameters:
#
# k = 0.1911 (IC_(95) [0.1694, 0.2129]
# a = 0.0039
# b = -0.019
#
# This implies 5-days old larvae to start becoming smurfs, which apparently depletes
# the population fast, according to my simulations. There may be an error in the
# implementation.
