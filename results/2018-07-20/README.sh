# Till now, I have used the two-phases model of aging, which is not a
# necessary part of the unguarded X hypothesis. I should implement other
# models, such as Weibull and Gompertz. Plus, I am not satisfied with the
# test run on 2018-05-22, because Tricoire and Rera's (2015) estimates of
# the parameters of the model produce older populations than observed in
# our experience (Pau Carazo).
