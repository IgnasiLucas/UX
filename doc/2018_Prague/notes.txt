This are some comments received after the talk.

1. For the comparative analysis, the effect of the dosage compensation system
   should be taken in to account. In mammals, many recessive deleterious
   mutations on the X chromosome will be exposed not only in males, but also
   in the cells of the female body where the other X chromosome is repressed.
   Thus, the unguarded X hypothesis would not apply as strongly to mammals as
   to flies.

2. Haplodiploids should also be mentioned in the comparative analysis. If males
   in some species are haploids, and if the unguarded X hypothesis is true, then
   those males must be quite sick, or die much earlier than females.

3. Why do we focus only on lifespan? If the unguarded X hypothesis is true,
   it could affect other traits. Juvenile mortality is a particularly interesting
   one. In principle, any dimorphic trait affecting fitness is susceptible of
   being explained by the unguarded X hypothesis.

4. The breeder's equation, and also the prediction of the change in directional
   dominance that John Kelly uses, look like equations of dynamic systems. Could
   those dynamics be expressed by differential expressions? If so, it is possible
   that Kelly's conclusion about how to estimate Cad/Va is false.
